#testing work with 2 digit numbers and 4 digit palindrome products
#later, the project will be 3 digit numbers and 9 digit palindrome products

num1 = 99
num2 = 99

first_half_num = 99
#find reverse_num
#put first_half_num and reverse_num together for full_num


check divisible #but only check while first num > second num
if not divisible, increment first_half_num down and redo

#99, 98, 97, 96, etc will find the greatest palindromes: 9999, 9889, 9669
#since we are looking for the largest product, we should begin by dividing by the largest (2 digit) integers
