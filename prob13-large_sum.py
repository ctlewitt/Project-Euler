#read in numbers
#might need to make them be "long"s
#add them together
#turn into string to find the length
#slice the first 10 digits
#print out (or turn into number, whatever you like)

#Something tells me it won't be this simple....based on number size....
#If it's not....
#Maybe I only need to add up the beginnings of the numbers
#How many extra digits would I need?
#How long does it take for "carrying" to propagate?
#We are adding numbers 100 times, after all....
